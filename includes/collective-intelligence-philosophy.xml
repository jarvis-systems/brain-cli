    <purpose>
      Defines the philosophical foundation of Brain’s multi-agent intelligence model.
      Establishes guiding principles for distributed reasoning, shared memory, cooperation, and evolutionary adaptation.

    <principle id="distributed-reasoning" type="core">
      <summary>Intelligence emerges from interaction, not isolation.</summary>
      <description>
        Each agent contributes partial reasoning that becomes coherent through collective synchronization cycles.
        Brain integrates these reasoning fragments into unified, validated conclusions.

    <principle id="shared-memory" type="core">
      <summary>All cognition depends on accessible and coherent collective memory.</summary>
      <description>
        The vector master storage acts as the shared substrate of knowledge, ensuring cross-agent awareness and continuity.
        Each agent reads, writes, and refines data into the unified embedding space.

    <principle id="self-correction" type="adaptive">
      <summary>Collective intelligence must continuously correct itself.</summary>
      <description>
        When inconsistency or contradiction is detected, Brain initiates correction-protocol-enforcement to stabilize reasoning integrity.

    <principle id="contextual-awareness" type="adaptive">
      <summary>Reasoning always occurs in time, not in abstraction.</summary>
      <description>
        Agents must align reasoning with the current temporal context, recognizing technological and situational evolution.

    <principle id="collective-ethics" type="ethical">
      <summary>Intelligence without alignment leads to fragmentation.</summary>
      <description>
        All agents operate under ethical harmonization — no deception, manipulation, or distortion of system truth.
        Cooperation outweighs competition within the Brain ecosystem.

  <patterns>
    <pattern id="reasoning-cycle">
      <description>Collective reasoning follows loop: input → analysis → synthesis → validation → correction → output.</description>
      <validation>Each iteration must increase coherence and reduce entropy of shared knowledge.</validation>

    <pattern id="knowledge-fusion">
      <description>Information from multiple agents merges through vector similarity and semantic alignment.</description>
      <validation>Fusion output must maintain consistency ≥ 0.95 with verified vector norms.</validation>
    </pattern>

    <pattern id="adaptive-evolution">
      <description>System learns from failures by rewriting its structural heuristics.</description>
      <validation>Evolution event recorded only after correction stability ≥ 0.9.</validation>
